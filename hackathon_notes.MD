Store Operations 
Mike Doucette,

focal = digital shelf 
manual operations in store 
our compeittors are doing this - 
longevity, purchasing and supply chain to make sure products get out the door

what are your suggestions about getting this in store
innovation team has projects that get cameras in the store
automate decision making in the store is to point a camera at it

igor's team - we don't have this camera data and we try to proxy it 
knowing how many people are in the store is actually really useful 

using mac addresses and bluetooth to get phones to ping out

talk to Dina about some of the work she's had to do 

Paul's consumer behavior - Igor

monetize on customer behaviour 
LCBO has a lab in Waterloo 

costs will be as follows: 
store operations - how to have them in stores, mounting, physical attributes
business = activities taken for thecost of profit 

find out what it would cost to sell through baabns before it goes bad 
if we could justify the offset of the cost with one product in a store with a sell-through
* just to pay for this exercise, selling at a rate of x, this many items
2. now, WE HAVE CAMERAS IN THE STORE THAT ARE TIED TO US - maintenance of the cameras , operations cost
so what else can we do 00 ancillary benefits
now we have the opportunity to tie some stuff into this 
additional revenue opportunities beyond this 
we estimate there would be more profitability 

scalability is an operational cost that will come out of the research
getting data in the cloud is infinitely scalable 
how high res do we have to go -- does it have the ability to filter out certain bandwidths of light?

TOP 3 THINGS customers give us feedback on is quality: 
in stock service, position and quality

IN STOCK, SERVICE, QUALITY 

one of the top 3 things that customers call out

FRESHNESS is the most important that in STOCK 
connect with existing camera system today -- can we use our existing cameras in stores 
whats the cost on a camera? 
- asset division


is this the only 

building in house is harder
look under the hood and then take it in house
kevin parry is building an in-house prescriptive analytic tool 
buy the one off the street as a service

yes there are companies that build in house and if there are companies in house that are doing the service contract 
maybe we explore them and bring them in for a POC, stand them up 
whos already in this space? 

we have our 

what about flashfoods? 
- its manual 
- we can help people with identifying flashfood
- flashfood today is about visualizing stuff 
this can help you identify these items throghout the day 
- flashfood is a more check-it and done

MD:
#1  identify the unsellable
#2  take the at risk-sellable and identify and re-purpose it through merchandising through flashfood exit strategies
	- whats the pricing strategy 
	- store support it using reduction sticker
	- exit it through flashfoods
	- if you go into store supported and put it into an app, 
		- how do you secure the product before the customer
		- is there another way to communicate the value to the customers 
		- people may not trust it if you cannot secure it 
		-

our partners would be Operations
the data we get back would be Operations
send it to the colleague and tell them immediately to take it off the shelf
send an alert to the colleague to remerchandise the product
want to take prescriptive action
real-time data is super crtiical

data analytics that are not patterns are 

our main customers are the customer
store ops, category management, supply chain

store levels: insgiths and real time tasks
category level: help with category assessment
supply chain: to manage inventory level and flow 

don't overcommit
if a third party is 

the data we feed to suppply chain then will help them figure out if their days on hadn are too much 

freshness is one of their values to their
